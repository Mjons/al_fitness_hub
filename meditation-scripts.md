# Coach Al Guided Meditation Scripts

Three guided meditations aligned with the core pillars of wellness.

---

## 1. Breath Awareness (Breathing Pillar)

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Focus:** Activating the parasympathetic nervous system through conscious breathing

### Script

Find a comfortable position. You can sit or lie down — whatever feels right.

Close your eyes, or soften your gaze toward the floor.

Take a moment to arrive. You don't need to change anything yet. Just notice where you are.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Now, bring your attention to your breath. Don't try to control it. Just observe.

Notice the air entering through your nose. Feel the slight coolness as it comes in.

Notice the warmth as it leaves.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now we'll practice box breathing. This is simple: breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4, hold for 4.

Let's begin.

**Breathe in** — 2, 3, 4.
**Hold** — 2, 3, 4.
**Breathe out** — 2, 3, 4.
**Hold** — 2, 3, 4.

*[Repeat 4 more cycles]*

Good. Now let your breath return to its natural rhythm.

Notice how your body feels. Perhaps your shoulders have dropped. Maybe your jaw has softened.

This is your nervous system shifting into rest mode. This is what recovery feels like.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

When you're ready, take one deep breath in... and let it go with a sigh.

Slowly open your eyes. Carry this calm with you.

## 2. Present Moment Awareness (Mindfulness Pillar)

**Duration:** 7-10 minutes
**Focus:** Cultivating non-judgmental awareness of the present moment

### Script

Settle into your seat. Feel the weight of your body supported beneath you.

Let your hands rest wherever they're comfortable.

Close your eyes.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

The mind likes to wander. It pulls us into the past — replaying conversations, reliving moments. It pushes us into the future — planning, worrying, anticipating.

Right now, we practice something different. We practice being here.

Start by noticing sounds around you. Don't label them as good or bad. Just notice they exist.

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Now bring attention to your body.

Start at the top of your head. Notice any sensations there. Tingling, pressure, warmth — or nothing at all. All of it is fine.

Move your attention slowly down...

Your forehead. Your eyes. Let them soften.

Your jaw. Is it clenched? Let it release.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Your neck and shoulders. These carry so much. Acknowledge that. Let them drop.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Down through your arms... your hands... your fingertips.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Your chest. Your belly. Rising and falling with each breath.

*[Pause 5 seconds]*

Your lower back. Your hips. Your legs.

All the way down to your feet.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now, hold your whole body in your awareness at once. You are here. You are whole. You are present.

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Thoughts will come. That's what minds do. When you notice you've drifted, gently — without judgment — return to the body. Return to now.

*[Pause 20 seconds]*

Take a deep breath in. Hold it at the top.

And release.

When you're ready, slowly open your eyes. Move gently. The world is still here — but perhaps you see it a little more clearly now.

## 3. Grounding & Space (Environment Pillar)

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes
**Focus:** Connecting with your physical environment and creating internal space

### Script

Before we begin, I want you to notice where you are. Look around for a moment.

What do you see? What objects are near you? What colors?

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now close your eyes.

Take three slow breaths. With each exhale, let yourself settle deeper into your space.

*[Pause for 3 breaths]*

Imagine roots growing from the base of your spine, down through the floor, deep into the earth below you.

These roots anchor you. They hold you steady. No matter what chaos exists around you, you are grounded.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now, feel the surface beneath you. If you're sitting, feel the chair supporting you. If you're lying down, feel the ground holding you up.

You don't have to hold yourself. You can let go. The earth has you.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Bring your attention to the space around you — the air touching your skin.

Feel the temperature. Is it cool? Warm? Neutral?

Feel the air fill the space between your fingers. The space around your arms. The space above your head.

You exist within this space. And this space is yours.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

Now imagine this space expanding. The walls dissolve. The ceiling lifts. You are surrounded by open sky.

Take a breath of that openness.

*[Pause 10 seconds]*

You are not your stress. You are not your to-do list. You are not your worries.

You are here. In this body. In this space. In this moment.

That is enough.

*[Pause 15 seconds]*

Slowly bring the walls back. Feel the room around you again.

Wiggle your fingers. Wiggle your toes.

Take one more deep breath.

Open your eyes.

You are grounded. You are present. You are ready.
