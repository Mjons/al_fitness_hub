# How Nutrition Targets Work

When you complete onboarding, the app calculates personalized daily nutrition targets based on your body stats and goals. These targets appear on the **Nutrition** and **Quick Meal Log** screens.

---

## What Data It Uses

The app collects these during onboarding (Steps 2 & 3):

| Field | Where Collected | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Weight | IntakeDemographics | 200 lbs |
| Age | IntakeDemographics | 30 |
| Sex | IntakeDemographics | Male / Female / Other |
| Goals | IntakeGoals | fat, muscle, energy, health |
| Experience | IntakeGoals | beg, int, adv |

**Height** is not collected. The app estimates from sex averages:
- Male: 5'9" (175.26 cm)
- Female / Other: 5'4" (162.56 cm)

## The Math (Step by Step)

### Step 1: BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)

How many calories your body burns just existing — sleeping, breathing, keeping your heart beating. Uses the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** (1990), considered the most accurate for general populations.

```
Male:    BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Female:  BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

Weight is converted from lbs to kg internally (× 0.453592).

**Example** — Male, 200 lbs (90.7 kg), 30 years old:
```
BMR = (10 × 90.7) + (6.25 × 175.26) - (5 × 30) + 5
    = 907 + 1095.4 - 150 + 5
    = 1,857
```

### Step 2: TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

Your BMR adjusted for how active you are. The app uses your **experience level** as a proxy for activity:

```
Experience Level    Multiplier    What It Means
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Beginner (beg)      × 1.375      Light activity (1-3 days/week)
Intermediate (int)  × 1.55       Moderate activity (3-5 days/week)
Advanced (adv)      × 1.725      Heavy activity (6-7 days/week)
```

**Example** — BMR 1,857 × intermediate (1.55):
```
TDEE = 1,857 × 1.55 = 2,878
```

### Step 3: Calorie Target

Your TDEE adjusted for your primary goal:

```
Goal            Adjustment              Floor
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Weight Loss     TDEE - 500 kcal         1,500 (M) / 1,200 (F)
Muscle Building TDEE + 300 kcal         none
Energy / Health TDEE (maintenance)      none
```

The -500 deficit equals roughly 1 lb/week of fat loss. The floor prevents dangerously low calorie targets.

**Goal priority** (if you selected multiple): fat > muscle > energy > health. The first match wins.

**Example** — TDEE 2,878, goal "fat":
```
Calories = 2,878 - 500 = 2,378
```

### Step 4: Protein Target

Based on body weight and goal:

```
Goal              Formula              Source
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Muscle Building   weight_kg × 1.8g     ISSN / Morton 2018
Weight Loss       weight_kg × 1.4g     ISSN (preserves muscle in deficit)
General           weight_kg × 1.2g     Active baseline
```

**Example** — 90.7 kg, goal "fat":
```
Protein = 90.7 × 1.4 = 127g
```

### Step 5: Fiber Target

Based on calorie target, per USDA Dietary Guidelines 2020-2025:

```
Fiber = (calories / 1,000) × 14g, clamped to 20–45g range
```

**Example** — 2,378 calories:
```
Fiber = (2,378 / 1,000) × 14 = 33g
```

### Step 6: Water Target

Based on body weight, per National Academy of Medicine:

```
Water (cups) = (weight_lbs × 0.5 oz) ÷ 8
```

**Example** — 200 lbs:
```
Water = (200 × 0.5) ÷ 8 = 12.5 → 13 cups
```

## Where the Numbers Show Up

### Nutrition Screen (NutritionSummary)

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Goal badge | "GOAL: WEIGHT LOSS" (or your primary goal) |
| Calorie card | Your daily calorie target |
| Protein card | Your daily protein target in grams |
| Fiber Focus tip | Your fiber target |

### Quick Meal Log Screen (NutritionLog)

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Greeting | "Fueling your day, {your name}!" |
| Coach Al's Tip | Your calorie, protein, and water targets |
| Today's Fuel | "No meals logged yet" (empty state) |

## What Happens When Data Is Missing

If weight, age, or sex aren't available (e.g., user somehow skipped onboarding), `calculateNutritionTargets()` returns `null` and the screens show `--` placeholders instead of numbers. The app never crashes from missing data.

## Full Example: 5 User Profiles

```

Male, 45, 250lbs, health, beg   2,206      136g      31g     16 cups
Female, 35, 160lbs, fat, beg    1,528      99g       21g     10 cups
Other, 28, 180lbs, energy, int  2,112      98g       30g     11 cups

## Code Location

All calculation logic lives in `lib/nutrition.js`. It's a pure utility — no storage, no state, no side effects. The component files just call `calculateNutritionTargets()` with the user's data and display the result.
